Real Estate Agent is a MERN Stack application.<br>
It is an E-Commerce Web App where you can buy luxury real estate in France.<br>
I used React, Redux-Toolkit and Sass for the frontend part of the app, and for the back-end I used MongoDB, Express and Node.<br>
There is a search function where you can filter data from an api request based on certain criteria.<br>
You can register for a newsletter and a magazine, and with each item in the list of real-estates you can make an enquiry for more information about the estate
and the information will be sent to your email address.<br>
The user can choose a payment method provided by Stripe.js. It is an integraded payment procedure so no redirect to stripe.<br>
A user can register and login. JSON Web Token is used for authentication and authorization.<br>
The owner can login as an administrator and perform exclusive tasks like delete a registered user or uplaod a new estate(document) to the database collection.<br>
A user can update his profile when logged in.<br>
All registered users are stored in a mongoDB database aswell as the data (real-estate-properties) that are loaded by default,
and all the email addresses of newsletter subscribers.<br>
The application is responsive.<br><br>
